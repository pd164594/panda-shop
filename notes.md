This project is an ERC-721 token for VR "Cryptopandas". Currently, the front-end allows you to purchase a random CryptoPanda Token, and the contract follows the ERC-721 protocol. This document includes notes on the requirements for the project.

## Run the Application
To run the application:

1. Start ```testrpc```
2. ```cd truffle && truffle compile && truffle migrate```
3. ```cp build/pandaownership.json ../a-panda/PandaOwnership.json```
4. ``` cd ../a-panda && npm install```
5. ```http-server```
6. Navigate to the provided url (most likely http://localhost:8080)


## Design Pattern Requirements

##### Emergency Stop
I have implimented an emergency stop that allows the contract creator to prevent purchasing of CryptoPandas in the case of an emergency/error in the contract code.

##### Fail Early Fail Loud
Contract functions begin with require statements to ensure that transactions are valid before executing contract code. 

#### Restricting Access
All functions related to control of CryptoPandas are restricted to the current Panda owner through the onlyOwnerOf modifier. This modifier ensures that the sender is the current owner of the Panda. In addition, the contract itself inherits from the ownable contract, which sets the account who deployed the contract as the owner, and only allows that user to transfer the contract.

## EthPM
Because this application did not require an EthPM package, I have included and example contract, 'ethPMExample.sol', which uses OpenZepplin's SafeMath library for uint256 math.
